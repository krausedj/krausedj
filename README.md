I am //DJK in the code.  I spent a majority of my career down in the C level, and some simulink automation, doing ABS/ESC, Airbags, and Brake by Wire.  Now I work on Autonomous Vehicle safety.  I have moved my primary focus onto C++ and Python for the time being.  And having a homelab hobby turned out to be a great hoppy for my transition onto the AV sector.

Now I am focused on hobbies, and really understanding make products from emerging ideas, which for now is LLMs and maybe crypto.
